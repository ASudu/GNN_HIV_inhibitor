# GNN_HIV_inhibitor
My first GNN project using PyTorch Geometric. In this repo, I follow [DeepFindr](https://www.youtube.com/@DeepFindr)'s walkthrough of the GNN project to perform graph classification task on the [HIV](https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1) dataset. The following tasks are performed:
- Graph classification: Given a molecule, classify it as `1` or `0` based on whether it is HIV inhibitor or not
- Graph generation: Generate random molecules and carry out the classification (synthetic data)
- Graph explain: Explainability of the GNN model
